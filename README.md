### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pymongo
- dnspython
- colorama

### MongoDB configuration
First you'll need to put your MongoDB connection string in `config.json`. If you don't know how to get it here's a quick tutorial: https://imgur.com/a/oXI34dA

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then __`python Main.py`__.

> Note: the entry file is named `Main.py` with a capital `M`. This matters on case-sensitive systems such as Linux.

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required.
Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/zDQzDYyB#V7GkrTFQpTfhTk_gOroMfdps5VFl8Lnn-CBX-bbnjlw) and change the IP in `libcb.config.so`, if you want to use Classic Brawl locally on your device, you can use "127.0.0.1" as the IP. If not, then you can use your device's IPv4 address.

#### The APK was recently updated to support Android 13+ and Emulators.
